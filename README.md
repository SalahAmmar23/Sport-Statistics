# Sport Statistics

This project reads game data from a file, processes team statistics, and outputs a specific team's number of games, wins, and losses.

## üìÑ Description

The program prompts the user for:

1. **A file name** containing match results.
2. **A team name** to analyze.

It then:

- Parses the file line by line, reading game results.
- Stores each match in a `Team` object inside an `ArrayList`.
- Calculates:
  - Total games played by the given team.
  - Number of wins.
  - Number of losses.

Finally, it prints these statistics.

## üìÇ Input File Format

Each line in the input file must follow the format:

```
HomeTeam,VisitingTeam,HomePoints,VisitingPoints
```

Example:

```
ENCE,Vitality,9,16
ENCE,Vitality,16,12
FURIA,NRG,7,16
```
